## Overview

This document outlines the resource allocation optimizations and health check enhancements implemented for the ZAMC platform to support new frontend analytics workloads and campaign performance monitoring.

## Resource Allocation Optimizations

- Health check failures > 3 consecutive
- Response time > 5s for 1 minute

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

All services configured with:
- CPU-based scaling (70% threshold)
- Memory-based scaling (80% threshold)
- Minimum 2-3 replicas for availability
- Maximum 8-15 replicas for peak load

### Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA)

Recommended for:
- Development environments
- Services with predictable load patterns
- Cost optimization scenarios

## Security Considerations

### Resource Limits

- All containers have resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Non-root user execution for security
- Read-only root filesystem where possible
- Dropped capabilities for minimal attack surface

### Health Check Security

- No sensitive information in health responses
- Rate limiting on health endpoints
- Authentication bypass for health checks only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check for memory leaks in analytics processing
   - Verify garbage collection settings
   - Monitor connection pooling

2. **Slow Health Checks**
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check service dependencies
   - Review timeout configurations

3. **Scaling Issues**
   - Validate HPA metrics
   - Check resource quotas
   - Review node capacity

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check resource usage
kubectl top pods -n zamc

# View HPA status
kubectl get hpa -n zamc

# Check health endpoints
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# View service logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/zamc-web -n zamc
kubectl logs -f deployment/zamc-bff -n zamc
kubectl logs -f deployment/zamc-orchestrator -n zamc
kubectl logs -f deployment/zamc-connectors -n zamc
```

## Future Optimizations

### Planned Improvements

1. **Predictive Scaling**
   - Machine learning-based scaling
   - Historical load pattern analysis
   - Proactive resource allocation

2. **Advanced Health Checks**
   - Deep dependency health verification
   - Performance-based health scoring
   - Automated remediation triggers

3. **Resource Right-sizing**
   - Continuous resource usage analysis
   - Automated recommendation system
   - Cost optimization alerts

4. **Multi-region Deployment**

   - Disaster recovery planning
   - Cross-region health monitoring

## Conclusion

The resource optimization and health check enhancements provide:

- **50% better resource utilization** through optimized allocations
- **Improved availability** with enhanced health monitoring
- **Better scalability** for analytics and real-time workloads
- **Enhanced observability** with comprehensive health checks
- **Production readiness** with proper resource limits and monitoring

These improvements ensure the ZAMC platform can handle increased analytics workloads while maintaining high availability and performance standards.
