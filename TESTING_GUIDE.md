## üåê Cross-Browser Testing

### Supported Browsers

#### Fully Supported
- **Chrome**: 90+
- **Firefox**: 88+
- **Edge**: 90+

#### Mostly Supported
- **Safari**: 14+ (some ES6 features may need polyfills)

### Testing Procedures

#### Manual Testing
1. Test core functionality in each browser
2. Verify CSS compatibility
3. Check JavaScript functionality
4. Test form submissions
5. Verify responsive behavior

#### Automated Testing
Use the `CrossBrowserTestSuite` component for:
- CSS feature support detection
- JavaScript compatibility checks
- Performance comparisons
- Accessibility consistency

### Browser-Specific Considerations

#### Safari
- Some ES6 features may need polyfills
- Different handling of form validation
- Unique CSS rendering behaviors

#### Firefox
- Different font rendering
- Unique developer tools
- Different performance characteristics

## üîç Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Accessibility
- **Missing ARIA labels**: Use browser dev tools accessibility panel
- **Color contrast failures**: Use contrast checking tools
- **Keyboard navigation issues**: Test with Tab key navigation

#### Responsive Design
- **Layout breaking**: Check CSS Grid/Flexbox implementation
- **Touch targets too small**: Verify minimum 44px size
- **Text too small**: Ensure minimum 16px font size

#### Performance
- **Slow loading**: Check network tab in dev tools
- **Layout shifts**: Identify elements causing CLS
- **JavaScript errors**: Check console for errors
