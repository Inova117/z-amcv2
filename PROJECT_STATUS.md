## 🚨 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### **High Risk Items**
1. **Frontend Completion Timeline** (🚨 CRITICAL)
   - **Risk**: Complex UI components may take longer than estimated
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel development, external contractor support, MVP feature scoping

2. **Third-party Security Audit** (🚨 CRITICAL)
   - **Risk**: Security issues could delay launch
   - **Mitigation**: Early audit scheduling, proactive security reviews, remediation buffer time

3. **Beta User Feedback** (🔥 HIGH)
   - **Risk**: Major UX issues discovered late in process
   - **Mitigation**: Early beta program, iterative feedback cycles, UX research validation

### **Medium Risk Items**
1. **AI Model Performance** (🟡 MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: ML models may not meet performance expectations
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback to rule-based optimization, gradual ML rollout

2. **Platform API Changes** (🟡 MEDIUM)
   - **Risk**: Google Ads/Meta API changes could break integrations
   - **Mitigation**: API versioning strategy, monitoring for deprecations
