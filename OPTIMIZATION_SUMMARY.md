### 2. Infrastructure Enhancements

#### New Services Added
- **Qdrant Vector Database**: 1000m-2000m CPU, 2Gi-4Gi memory
- **Enhanced NATS**: JetStream support for event streaming
- **Improved PostgreSQL**: Optimized for analytics workloads

#### Resource Limits Applied
- All services now have proper resource limits and reservations
- Prevents resource exhaustion and improves stability
- Better resource utilization across the cluster

### 3. Health Check Enhancements

#### Frontend Health Dashboard
- **Real-time monitoring** of all services
- **Performance metrics** tracking (response time, uptime)
- **Auto-refresh** every 30 seconds
- **Visual indicators** for service status
- **Detailed error reporting** with JSON response parsing

#### Enhanced Service Endpoints

**BFF GraphQL API** (`/health`, `/ready`):
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "service": "ZAMC BFF GraphQL API",
  "services": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "redis": "healthy", 
    "nats": "healthy",
    "graphql": "healthy"
  },
  "uptime": "2h30m15s"
}
```

**Orchestrator Service** (`/health`, `/campaign-performance/health`):
- Main service health with dependency checks
- Campaign performance monitoring status
- AI/ML service availability

**Connectors Service** (`/health`, `/ready`, `/metrics`):
- Platform connectivity status (Google Ads, Meta)
- Deployment statistics and metrics
- Service readiness indicators

### 4. Configuration Improvements

#### Environment Variables Added
```bash
# Analytics & Performance
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_CAMPAIGN_PERFORMANCE_WS=ws://localhost:4000/graphql
VITE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES=true

# Campaign Monitoring
CAMPAIGN_MONITORING_ENABLED=true

```

#### Deployment Configurations
- **Docker Compose**: Resource limits, enhanced health checks
- **Kubernetes Helm**: Memory-based autoscaling, WebSocket ingress support
- **Security**: Non-root containers, read-only filesystems, dropped capabilities

### 5. Testing & Monitoring Tools

#### Health Check Scripts
- **Bash script** (`scripts/test-health-endpoints.sh`) for Linux/macOS
- **PowerShell script** (`scripts/test-health-endpoints.ps1`) for Windows
- **Features**: Colored output, JSON parsing, timeout handling, wait functionality

#### Monitoring Capabilities
- **Service discovery** and automatic endpoint testing
- **Performance benchmarking** with response time tracking
- **Failure detection** with detailed error reporting
- **Continuous monitoring** with configurable intervals

## ðŸ“Š Performance Improvements

### Scaling Optimizations
- **CPU thresholds**: Reduced from 80% to 70% for more responsive scaling
- **Memory scaling**: Added memory-based autoscaling (80% threshold)
